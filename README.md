Predicting The Most Dangerous Areas For Flood Disasters Using NASA EarthData  Many areas around the world are affected by flood and other water related disasters  due to rise in earths temperature, climate change and many other factors. Most of these risky areas are in a zone called the 10m Low Elevation Zone. But there are too many areas in this zone. So non-profit organizations can not help all of them. We analyse the mortality risk, population density, economic damage, frequency and distribution of flood occurrences and various other data to find out and categorize the most risky areas in the 10m Low Elevation Zone. Then we present the results visually and in an easily accessible application, So that any related authority can easily find out the areas that require their help the most.
